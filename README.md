### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**BenReichelt/BenReichelt** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an artistic style transfer project for my ML image course, and Google AppScripts for spreadsheet organization/manipulation for Harvard DCE.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about opencv2.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my favorite books, movies, or games!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: reichelt@bu.edu
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Master of Dance Dance Revolution and Guitar Hero. And I speak Portuguese.

I am a graduating computer science student from Boston University who is looking for a job/project where I can gain valuable work experience while applying the skills and knowledge I have accrued during my time at BU, and working on various projects.
